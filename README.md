# Music Helper

As I start my journey learning music theory I wanted to create an app that helps me with naming chords. I knew the shapes of many chords, but I was not able to name them all. 

The idea grew and I want others to benefit from it as well. It will have more features coming soon, along with resources to learn more about a specific topic.
