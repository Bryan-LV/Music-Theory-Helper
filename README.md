# Music Helper

As I start learning more about music theory I wanted to create an app that helps me figure out what chords I am playing.

The idea is for this app to help me recognize chords easier by typing in the notes I am playing. I also want an app that
can help me remember my scales, and if I'm curious, then take a peak at new scales.

I want to easily type in a note and get back what ever scale I want. Along with the info on how that scale is built and maybe some extra information.
